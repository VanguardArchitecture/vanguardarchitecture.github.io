<ul class="alternate">
    
<li>Embracing product ownership (example: Base Camp One)</li>
    
<li>Getting our communication tooling situated</li>
    
<li>Learned a process to go from Vision -&gt; Business Goals -&gt; Epics --&gt; User Stories</li>
    
<li>Working on integrating various tools, such as Jira, Github, aha.io and Wiki. More to do.</li>
    
<li>Decided that Python will be the language of choice for code-snippets and examples. Started learning
        Python using Code School. Easy to consume, useful... I can see why it is so popular.</li>

        We have identified a critical need that has strong value, but needs a non-traditional approach.</li>

<h1>Podcasts</h1>

<p><a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/10/27/david-heinemeier-hansson/">This is a podcast</a>&nbsp;by
    Tim Ferriss&nbsp;with major mashups of interests. Coding (it is with the creator of Ruby on Rails),
    Systems Thinking, Car Racing, Flow, and much more&hellip; Well worth the time.</p>

<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<ul class="alternate">
    
<li>Stumbled upon pages.github. Created&nbsp;<a href="https://vanguardarchitecture.github.io">vanguardarchitecture.github.io</a></li>
    
<li>Discovered how to run Cloud Foundary on a laptop (resource hog).&nbsp;</li>
    
<li>It appears there are two major Open Source coding ecosystems: Atlassian and Github. A lot of companies
        are supporting both, but choices and ease of integration is a trade off. For example, we could
        use Github Issues and similar things to have a Jira-like experience. I am thinking we go that
        way for one of the efforts to see how it plays out.</li>
</ul>

<h1>List of Actions and Communications</h1>
